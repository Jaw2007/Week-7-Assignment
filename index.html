        <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
        <p>For me what worked well was going through the HTML and CSS book and watching the assigned videos. </p>
        <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
        <p>For me I think we should be given more time for assignments and have at least one more chance to get a better grade on a quiz.</p>
        <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h1>
        <p>I did, i came in wanting to learn more about how the css works and I got my answers and learned more then I originally thought I would in the end.</p>
        <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
        <p>For me what ended up being a very new experience was the bootstrap grids, as for what I've already encountered was the colors/background colors since I attended the html class and we went over a lot of that stuff.</p>
